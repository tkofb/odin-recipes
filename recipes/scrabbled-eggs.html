            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Black Pepper</li>

            <li>In a medium mixing bowl, aggressively whisk together the eggs, half-n-half, and salt until the mixture is uniform in color and texture, and is light and foamy, without any separate streaks of yolk or whites and melt the butter in a small nonstick pan over medium heat, until the butter coats the whole pan and just starts to foam.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs to the center of the pan and immediately reduce the heat to medium-low and then remove from the heat when the eggs still shimmer with some moisture</li>
        </ol>
