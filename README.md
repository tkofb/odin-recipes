# odin-recipes

This is simply the beginning of my first project where I am making a recipe website

For future reference honestly didn't update git because the project seemed really easy

Dated: Sitting at my computer instead of doing my homework at 8:55 on a Wednesday which is my only day off (working at Wendy's and Mcdonalds currently). Hopefully you succeed and change the world in whatever you want to do. (As a high school senior 5 days before progress reports are released).
